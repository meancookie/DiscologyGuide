# Discology Offline Server Network Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the setup needed to broadcast a Discology session offline. We'll first configure your Mac as a DHCP server with a static IP, then configure the Unifi Network Hardware and then test the setup end to end.

# Setup DHCP Server

We'll start by setting up a DHCP Server on your Mac, this will be used temporarily to set up the UniFi devices. Once you have your Unifi devices set up and assiged static IPs, this will no longer be needed.

# macOS
1. Config local wired network interface card to static IP
- Open Network Preferences
- IP address - 10.0.0.1
- Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0
- Router - 10.0.0.1

2. Check the network interface id of your wired network

- Open Terminal application and execute run `ifconfig`.
- Find the line with ip same as 10.0.0.1. In my case shown below this was `en5`.
```console
en5: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	options=6467<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO,PARTIAL_CSUM,ZEROINVERT_CSUM>
	ether 00:e0:4c:03:1b:1a 
	inet6 fe80::439:7541:d7cb:a7e1%en5 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x16 
	inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
	media: autoselect (1000baseT <full-duplex>)
	status: active
```

3. Create DHCP Server config file: bootpd.plist
- Open Terminal application and execute script as following
``` shell
sudo vi /etc/bootpd.plist
```
- Copy the network interface identifier to the bootpd.plist file below, replace the right network interface card id `en0` with the id you found in the step above, in my example `en5`.
``` xml

To save a file and quit in Vim, press ```Esc``` key, type ```:wq``` and hit Enter key.

4. Start DHCP Server
``` shell
sudo /bin/launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist
```
5. Stop DHCP Server
``` shell
sudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist
```

### Testing VLAN Configuration
Hopefully everything went well and you are now ready to test this setup. You are now going to unplug your laptop from Port 1 which you have been using to configure your hardware and into Port 3 which you will use to stream.

Before you plug your laptop into Port 3, you want to set your network device back to `Using DHCP` from `Manually`

If everything works correctly, your laptop should now get an IP address in the `10.10.0.xxx` range, I got `10.10.0.48`.

### Testing End To End
Now that your network setup is complete you are ready to test end to end. You'll need a phone running the Discology app handy for this test in addition to your Laptop with the Discology Pro app. You'll need to have setup an offline stream in advance of going offline, you can't yet create a new offline stream while offline.

* Ensure Wifi is turned off on your laptop and phone
* Connect phone to WiFi network `discology vlan` you created above
* Start Discology Pro on your laptop.
* Go to the "Offline Streams" tab in Discology Pro
* Start your offline stream, start OBS and ensure that you start the stream in OBS
* Open your Discology app on your phone, you should see a banner in the top right corner for an offline event, click on that.
* You should now be getting audio from your laptop to the phone all routed locally.

## Purge Unifi Network Application Site Data
1. Delete the UniFi Network application from the Applications section.
2. Delete the folder: ~/Library/Application Support/UniFi/
